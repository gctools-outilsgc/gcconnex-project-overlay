This is an interactive visualization showing the interconnectedness of groups, projects and people on GCconnex, the Government of Canada's internal social networking and collaboration platform. Users can search for projects pertaining to things that matter to them, discover related projects or simply explore existing ones. 

Clicking a project on the tree brings up a quick overview, a list of key contributors and a link to its main page.
